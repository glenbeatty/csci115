VIU CSCI 115 Final Project (Spring 2023)

Difficult task attempted:  Customized UI for optimized mobile experience.

- Used CSS @media tag to create 3 viewport-size breakpoints, where user css styling changes to optimize user interface.
    - These breakpoints adjust the user interface based on the number of horizontal pixels their viewport (or device) has.
    - The breakpoints are as follows:
        - More than 1200 horizontal pixels: 
            - Outer container/wrapper has 65% width. Content occupies 65% of screen.
        - Between 1000 and 1199 horizontal pixels:
            - Outer container/wrapper has 80% width. Content occupies 80% of screen.
        - Between 600 and 999 horizontal pixels:            
            - Outer container/wrapper has 96% width. Content occupies nearly 100% of screen.
        - Fewer than 600 horizontal pixels:
            - Switch to mobile-optimized display. All navigation elements switch to vertical blocks, with nothing side-by-side.
            - Logo and navigation menu items are stacked and centered. 
            - Navigation menu text is made larger, so it will be easier to click on mobile.
            - All container elements are switched to block format.


Bonus/maybe not difficult (created favicon using free online tool, and included that in design.)
